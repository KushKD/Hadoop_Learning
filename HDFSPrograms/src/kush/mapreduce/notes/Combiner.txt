Combiner

Where combiner must be used 
 
 Commutative  = A+B =B+A
 Associative  = (A+B)+C == A+(B+C)
 
 Combiner is a optimization technique to fastern the job execution
 Combiner reduces the number of key value pairs to be transmitted to reducer
 It runs locally on each mapper
 It can run 0,1 or n number of times on a mapper
 Also known as Mini Reucer
 It should be used where the nture of problem is Associative and Commutative
