Input Splits

Hadoop Stores the data in the form of Data blocks on various data nodes. The input file is divided into smaller chunks
with each chunk equal to hadoop block size and is stored as physical data block.
An Input split may contain any number of Records.

Input Splits is a Logical representation of Blocks
It ensures that a record is completely processed by a mapper
Each mapper processes exactly 1 input split
Input split size is calculated by formula
 
Max (minimum size , Min(maxsize,blocksize))
