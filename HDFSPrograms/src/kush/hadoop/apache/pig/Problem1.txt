Learn to filter the data set Group the data set aggregation limit the number of records and ordering
the data set.We will also see how to run the instructions as a script and we'll also see how to pass parameters into a big script.

Question: List the Top 10 Stock Symbols for year 2003 with the highest average volume

Load the dataset
stocks = LOAD 'dataset/stocks' USING PigStorage(',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:datetime, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float,volume:int, adj_close:float);
DESCRIBE stocks

Filter the Dataset (Only Records for the year 2003)
filterByYear = FILTER stocks by GetYear(date) == 2003;

Group the record by Symbol to calculate the average 
groupBySymbol = GROUP filterByYear by symbol;

Now we have to perform the aggregreation
DESCRIBE groupBySymbol;

groupBySymbol:{ group: chararray,
					filterByYear: {(
							exchange: chararray,
							symbol: chararray,
							date: datetime,
							open: float,
							high: float,
							low: float,
							close: float,
							volume: int,
							adj_close: float)}
}

Now Calculate the Average Salary on the Group Records
avg_volume = FOREACH groupBySymbol GENERATE group , ROUND(AVG(filterByYear.volume)) as avgVolume;

Now Order the Result in Decending Order
avg_volume_ordered = ORDER avg_volume BY avgVolume DESC;

Store Top 10 Records
top10 = LIMIT avg_volume_ordered 10;
STORE top10 INTO 'output' USING PisSTorage(',');

To execute everything as a Script hust run this command
pig /hdfs/url/file.pig 

To execute a Pig Script with PArametes
pig -param input=/hdfs/path.pig -param output=/hdfs/output_directory /hdfs/url/file.pig 

### RUNNING A PIG SCRIPT LOCALLY. INPUT AND OUTPUT LOCATION ARE POINTING TO LOCAL FILE SYSTEM ###

pig -x local -param input=/hirw-workshop/input/stocks-dataset/stocks -param output=output/stocks /hirw-workshop/pig/scripts/average-volume-parameters.pig
