Apache Pig Takes a set of Instructions from the user and converts those instructions to map reduce jobs and execute the map reduce jobs in clusters.

What are the challanges faced by Map  Reduce
	Conceptually visualize a problem in Map Reduce
	Knowledge of a Programming Language
	Requires lot of coding to do simple stuff for e.g. Joins
	Time and Effort 
	
How a tool can replace the need for a Program and Programming?

History of Apache Pig!
  Apache Pig is developed at Yahoo
  First Release - Sep 2008
  Pig is a Client Tool , means no installation needs to be done on all the nodes in hadoop cluster. PIG instilaation comes with a 
  data flow language i.e. PIG LATIN  which defines the instuctions that user will use to work with the data.
  									The Instructions will then be analized by the engine and translated to Map Reduce Jobs
  									These Map reduce Jobs are then submitted to the Cluster
  			As long as we have Pig installed in one of our nodes in the cluster or we have a node which have access to the cluster
  			we are good to go.
  			
  PIG uses HDFS and MAP REDUCE models behind the scene
  Smae implementation/phases as a MR Program
  
  
  ===================================================
  PIG LATIN											|
  ===================================================
  PIG LATIN is a simple to use Data Flow Language
  As a user you typically write a series of instructions using PIG LATIN e.g.
  							To Load the Data we use the LOAD Operator
  							To Filter the Data we use the FILTER Opeartor
  							To Group the Data we us the Group Operator
  							Pig LATIN also comes witht the Aggregrate Functions i.e. Average, Min, Max
  							PIG analize, optimize the instructions and construct and submit MR Jobs
  							
  				Philosophies while Developoing Apache Pig
  						PIG eats Everything
  						PIG Flies  (designed with Big Data performanc requirements in mind)
  						PiGs are Domestic Animals (Designed to be easily controlled and modified by its users)
  						Pigs Lives anywhere Its a language for parallel data processing 
  						
  						
  Pig installation in Hadoop Clustor
  /usr/lib/pig
  pig
  
  
In order to work with a dataset in PIG, we need to first Load a dataset
Syntax for the load operator is very simple
In Pig Latin a dataset is reffers to as a Relation
grunt> stocks = LOAD '/home/hirwuser1249/stocks/stocks' USING PigStorage(',') as (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray, date:datetime, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float,
volume:int, adj_close:float);
