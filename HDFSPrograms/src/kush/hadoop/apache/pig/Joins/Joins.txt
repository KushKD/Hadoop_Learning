Joins  With Equality Conditions

When We have more than one Dataset, it is natural to join them and project resut in a meaningful way.

Inner Join, Left Outer Full Outer Join 

We have two Datasets 
Stocks and Divident

Lets dee the Dividends Dataset

ABCSE,B7J,2009-11-12,0.15

ABCSE Exchange
B7J  Symbol
2009-11-12  Date when the Dividend is Issued
0.15   Amount of Dividend Issued

First Load Stocks and Divident Dataset

stocks = LOAD 'dataset/stocks' Using PigStorage(',') AS ();
divs = LOAD 'dataset/dividend'  Using PigStorage (',') AS (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray,date:datetime,amount:float);

Question We want to get all the stock information for the day when the divident was Issued?
Its a classic inner join

innerJoin = JOIN stocks BY (symbol, date) , divs BY (symbol, date);	
DESCRIBE innerJoin;

innerJoin: {
	stocks::exchange: chararray,
	stocks::symbol: chararray,
	stocks::date: datetime,
	stocks::open: float,
	stocks::high: float,
	stocks::low: float,
	stocks::close: float,
	stocks::volume: int,
	stocks::adj_close: float,
	divs::exchange: chararray,
	divs::symbol: chararray,
	divs::date: datetime,
	divs::dividends: float
	}

join_project  = FOREACH join_inner GENERATE stocks::symbol, divs::date, divs::dividends;
DUMP join_project;
	
	
	
Left Outer Join Operation
A Left Join brings all the data from the Lest side of Dataset with the matching record on the right hand side of the data set if the
values are matched. If no values are mached null values are substituted from the right hand side .

leftJoin = JOIN stocks BY (symbol,date) LEFT OUTER , divs BY (symbol,date);
DESCRIBE leftJoin;
DUMP leftJoin;

Limit the records to 100
Limit100 = LIMIT leftJoin 100;
DUMP Limit100;

## Filter out records with no matching Dividends or no Dividend
filterLeftJoin = FILTER leftJoin BY divs::symbol IS NOT NULL;
DUMP filterLeftJoin;

RIGHT OUTER JOIN OPERATION
joinRight = JOIN stocks BY (symbol,date) RIGHT OUTER , divs BY (symbol,date);
DUMP joinRight;
Right Outer joins brings all the records from the Right side and all the matching columns from Left side.

FULL OUTER JOINs
Full outer joins is a combination of Left Outer Joins and Right Outer Joins. When there is a match all the columns from the Left and Right
are given and when there is no match null is substituted.
joinRight = JOIN stocks BY (symbol,date)  FULL , divs BY (symbol,date);
DUMP joinRight;
