Do a join between stocks and dividends when symbols don't match in either file?

Joins with non equality condition is very difficult to implement in Map Reduce. Hence there in no direct PIG LAtin Instruction
to Do that.

We do the Cross Join and then we apply the filter

###CROSS###

--Takes every record in stocks and combines it with every record in divs
grunt> crs = CROSS stocks, divs;

--What about non equi joins?

grunt> non_equi = FILTER crs by stocks::symbol != divs::symbol;

grunt> limit1000 = LIMIT non_equi 1000; 


Question) Can we Do Join In Pigs with more than two tables?
Answer: Yes we can do. But Only Inner joins can be implemented with multiple Tables. We cannot mix inner and Outer Joins with 
more than two tables. Its also called Multiway Joins

Also, The Join key has to be same in all the tables.


### Multiway Join ###

grunt> join_multi = JOIN stocks by (symbol, date), divs by (symbol, date), cmp by symbol;
##This is not a valid multiway join statement becauee of cmp by symbol;
--Multiway join is only possible on inner joins and not on outer joins
grunt> join_multi = JOIN stocks by symbol, divs by symbol, cmp by symbol;
##This is a valid Multijoin statement

grunt> DUMP join_multi;

Question: How to use a Join without using a JOIN Operator?
Answer: Using a COGROUP

###COGROUP###
grunt> cgrp = COGROUP stocks BY (symbol, date), divs by (symbol, date);

cgrp: {
	group: (symbol: chararray,date: chararray),
	stocks: {(exchange: chararray,symbol: chararray,date: chararray,open: float,high: float,low: float,close: float,volume: int,adj_close: float)},
	divs: {(exchange: bytearray,symbol: bytearray,date: bytearray,dividends: bytearray)}
	}
