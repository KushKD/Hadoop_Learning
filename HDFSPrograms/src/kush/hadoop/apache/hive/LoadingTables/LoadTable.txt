Loading Hive Tables:

 INSERT...SELECT
 LOCATION
 
Execute HDFS commands from HIVE Shell directory using !
hive> !hadoop fs -ls 
The above command runs HDFS commandd in HIVE SHELL

hive> LOAD DATA INPATH 'input/hive/stocks_db' INTO TABLE stocks;
The LOAD command moves the dataset from the HDFS to the Table LOCATION in HDFS .Note it does not copy the dataset , it moves the dataset.

 CTAS (CREATE TABLE AS SELECT):- Basically we will be copying the stocks table into another table.
 								 We are creating a table using select.That is why it is called CTAS.
 								 
 								 Copy the contents of stocks not move to stocks_cts table.
