 
 # Segregationg of Data into various directoreis
 
 
 
 
 
 There are two types of Partitioning Static and dynamic.
 They do partition the data into various directories and how they do it is different.
 
 Static Partition We have to load the data into static parrtition manually. we should know what data is coming and in which partition we have to put it
 into.
 
 Creating a partition table:
   
   create table  if not exists par_table (
   depno int,
   employeename string,
   salary int
   )
   partitioned by (department_name string)
   row format delimited fields terminated by ','
   stored as textfile;
   
   load data inpath 'dataset/data.txt' into table par_table  partition (deptname ='HR') ;
   
   insert into table par_table partition (deptname ='HR') select col1,col2,col3 from dept where col2='hr';
   
   Dynamic Partitioning:
   By default dynamic partitioning is disabled. We have to enable it by this property
   set hive.exec.dinamic.partition = true;
   We also need to change the mode
   set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict ; //by default it is strict mode
   
    Creating a partition table:
   
   create table  if not exists par_table1 (
   depno int,
   employeename string,
   salary int
   )
   partitioned by (department_name string)
   row format delimited fields terminated by ','
   stored as textfile;
   insert into table par_table partition (deptname) select col1,col3,col4,col2  from dept ;
   #the column in which partitioning is donw should be in the last
   
   
   Which partitioning type to use and when?
   Static partitioninig is fast than dynamic 
   
   show partitions table_name;
   
   #To drop a partition froma table 
   alter table table_name drop partition (table_name_part_name = 'HR');
   
   #To add a partition
    alter table table_name add partition (table_name_part_name = 'DEV');
    LOAD DATA INPATH 'dataset/dev.txt' INTO TABLE table_name  partition (deptname ='DEV') ;
    
   #add a partition
    alter table  table_name add partition (table_name_part_name = 'FINANCE');
    
    We can also use MSCK REPAIR DIRECTORY COMMAND
    msck repair table table_name;
