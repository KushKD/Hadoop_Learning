Bucketing

Another data organizing technique in Hive
All the same column values of a bucketed column will go into same bucket
Can be used alone or along with Partition
Best Practice to create a partition then a bucket


	Employee Id   Department   Salary
	
	First create Partitions
	 HR 
	 Account
	 Finance
	 
	 Then creating Buckets
	 1st bucket contains salary range from 10000 till 50000 on the basis of hashing algorithm
	 2nd bucket contains salary range from 50000 till 70000
	 
A bucket is a file where as a partition is a Directory.
Bucket is a Physical File in table diractory
We can explicitly set the number of buckets according to datasets.
Partitioning and Bucketing are used side by side to achieve the highest level of optimizations
Two bucketed tables will be joined very fast in hive (Both joining tables should be bucketed on the same column as per the joining column
and both tables should have equal number of buckets.
e.g.

10,Accounts,Joyce,2098,Delhi
dept_id,dept_name,emp_name,emp_salary,emp_loc

create table if not exists department (
dept_id  int,
dept_name string,
emp_name  string,
emp_salary int,
emp_loc   string
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS textfile;
LOAD DATA INPATH 'dataset/bucketData.txt) INTO department;

#Now CREATING TABLE 2 
create table if not exists department_pat (
dept_id  int,
emp_name  string,
emp_salary int,
emp_loc   string
)
PARTITIONED BY (dept_name string)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS textfile;
insert into table department_pat partition (dept_name) select col1,col3,col4,col5,col2  from department ;

#By Default bucketing is not enabled, so we have to enable it
set.hive.enforce.bucketing = true;
set hive.exec.dinamic.partition = true;
set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict ; 

#Now creating the bucketing table
create table if not exists department_bucket (
dept_id  int,
emp_name  string,
emp_salary int,
emp_loc   string
)
PARTITIONED BY (dept_name string)
CLUSTERED BY (emp_loc)
INTO 4 BUCKETS
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS textfile;
insert into table department_bucket partition (dept_name) select col1,col3,col4,col5,col2  from department ;
show partitions department_bucket;
## Whatever number of task we provide the reduce task would be that
