Collection of sample data from number of buckets is callled table sampling.

e.g.
SELECT * FROM dept_bucket LIMIT 15;
The result will show data from just one bucket , and not from all.


select dept_id,emp_name,emp_salary,emp_location from dept_bucket tablesample (bucket 1 out of 2 on emp_location);
Now what tablesample function is doing.
It is dividing your four buckets into group of 2 buckets each and then selecting first bucket of every group.

tablesample (bucket 1 out of 3 on emp_location);
It is dividing your four buckets into group of 3 buckets each and then selecting first bucket of every group.

tablesample (2 percent);
It will allow hive to get 2 % of the dataset.

tablesample (1M);
It will allow hive to pick atleast 1MB of data.

tablesample (20 ROWS);
It will allow hive to pick atleast 1MB of data.

Gaurding our table
NO_DROP command will prevent out table from being accendenlty dropped.
alter table dept_bucket enable no_drop;
alter table dept_bucket disable no_drop;

#prevent a specific partition to be safe and not the other partitions
alter table dept_partition partition (dept_name='HR') enable no_drop;


OFFLINE : unable to view the table as it is offline.
alter table dept_bucket enable offline;
alter table dept_bucket disable offline;

This command can be limited to a partitin table too
alter table dept_partition partition (dep_name='HR') enable offline.
