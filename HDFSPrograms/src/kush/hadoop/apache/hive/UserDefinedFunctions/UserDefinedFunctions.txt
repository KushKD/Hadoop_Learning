We can Create our own functions when built in functions do not serve the purpose.
Functions are mostly written in JAVA LANGUAGE
There are some rules to be adhered to while writing USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS

STEPS:-
		CREATE A JAVA PROGRAM IN ANY PLATFORM
		SAVE OR CONVERT THE PROGRAM INTO A JAR FILE
		ADD THAT JAR FILE INTO HIVE
		CREATE FUNCTION OF THE JAR FILE ADDED
		USE THOSE FUNCTIONS IN HIVE QUERY
