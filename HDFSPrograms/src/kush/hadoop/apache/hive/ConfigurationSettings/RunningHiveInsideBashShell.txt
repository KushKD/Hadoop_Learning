Firing Hive Queries from Bash Shell

	we have two options for this:
				-e  is to fire a hive query from bash shell
				-f  is to fire a hive script from bash shell
				-h  print help information
				-s  silent mode to avoid operational messages
				-i <filename> File Initialization  //takes the script file name and initializes the variables inside it
				-h <server> connect hive server to remote host
				-p <port number> connect hive server on port number
				-v execute the verbose mode
				
So in bash shell inside hadoop path we have to write
       hive -e 'select * from employee;'
       
Running multiple hive queries in a single command

		hive -e 'select * from employee; select * from employee where col6=20;'	
		
		
		
Running Hive Scripts inside HIVE Shell
	
	Create a Hive Script	
	  New Doc 
	  	select * from employee; 
	  	select * from employee where col6=20;
	  Save DOC as script.hql
	  
	  Hive script is created
	hive>  source /home/hirwuser1249/hive/script.hql
	
Inside Bash Shell 
		hive -f  /home/hirwuser1249/hive/script.hql
