An Index acts as reference to records.
Used to speed up searching the data
Will search for only portion of data and not the whole data.set.

PArtition is done at HDFS LEVEL 
Indexing is done at Table Level

Since Hive works with large dataset. Indexing is Benificial Here.

#Creating an Index
=========================

create index i1 on table table9(col3) as 'COMPACT' with deferred rebuild;  //Index table empty

i1 == index name
table9 == Table name
col3  == column on which index is to be built

'COMPACT' with deferred rebuild meaning
===============================================
Why we have use COMPACT  , becauese we can use two types of indexes on a table 

  COMPACT 
  BITMAP   
  
  Both these indexes searves the same pupose but can give different fetching time based on the data of indexing columns.
  The main difference between the two is, Storing of Mapped values of rows in differnt blocks.
  
  Compact  == BLOCK ID + VALUE
           == Index Value + List of ROws as BITMAP
           
           
with deferred rebuild == because we need to alter the index in later stages.
#Altering the Index
=====================
alter index i1 on table9 rebuild;  //update our index, now the index table gets populated


Creating Indexes Other Types and Format.
=====================================================================================================================
create index i1 on table table9(col3) as 'COMPACT' with deferred rebuild storing as rcfile;
create index i1 on table table9(col3) as 'COMPACT' with deferred rebuild row format delimited fields terminated by '\n' stored as textfile;



Multiple Index for a sample Table and any type of Index on same table.

Creating a Bitmap Index on same Table
=======================================
create index i1 on table table9(col3) as 'BITMAP' with deferred rebuild;
alter index i1 on table9 rebuild;  //Table indexing is incomplete without this command.

We can have any number of Compact and BITMAP indexing on the same column in a table.

#Check the number of Indexes for a table.
==============================================
Show formatted index on table9;

#Droping Compact index
================================================
drop index i1 on table9;


WHEN AND WHERE TO USE INDEXING
===================================================
WHEN TO USE
		DATASET IS LARGE (GB)
		SPEED IS CONCERNED
		FREQUENT USE OF WHERE CLAUSE IN QUERY
		
		
WHEN NOT TO USe
		DATASET IS UNIQUE
		NO FREQUENT USE OF WHERE CLAUSE IN THE QUERY.
