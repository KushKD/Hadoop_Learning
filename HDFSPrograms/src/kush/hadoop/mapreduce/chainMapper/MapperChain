Chain Mapper

Chaaining of Multiple Mappers. Meaning Output of one mapper will go to second mapper
as Input and the output of second Mapper will become input to Third mapper.Tis chain will to number of mappers
we add and in the end the output of last mapper will go as input to the reducer.
All these mappers will run in a single map task.

Benifits:-
MAppers become reusabe with their own logic
