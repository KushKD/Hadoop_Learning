COUNTERS

Counters is a way to calculate the number of operations within a Mapreduce job.
Useful for gathering Statestics about the map reduce job.Also used for problem diagnostics
Whenever a Map Reduce Job Starts execution hadoop initiates counters to collect Job statistics.
Some of the typical Operations of Hadoop Counters are to get the stats about following.
		Number of Mappers and Reducers are launched
		No of Bytes Read and written
		No of tasks launched and Ran
		No of Bytes shuffelled across nodes
		Amount of CPU memory consumed  in the job
		
Counters can be of two types
	Built in Counters
	Custom Counters
	
	By default Map Reduce provides built in counters
		Built In Counters can be categorized into three Types
				MapReduce Task Counters   Already handled by Hadoop
				File System Counters  They track two main things The number of bytes read by file system by map and reduce task and the number of bytes written by each file system by map and reduce task.
				Job Counters
	
To have better monitoring of the Job Hadoop provides a way to create a custom Counter.
