What are Map Joins and Where They are Used

Join is performed on Mapper Side Rather than going to a Reducer Phase
Is Used Where Files to be joined have varied Data Structure and not 1 common column key

Is used where files/tables are small enough to be fit into Mappers memory

USed as optimisation technique , at least one dataset should be small enough to be fit into Mappers family

Suppose We have three files
Product Sales and Store

Product

		Product ID   Product Name   Product Category   Product Rate
		PR_1			Shoes			Sport				40


Sales
		Store_id	Product_ID					Time    				No of Sales
		STR_1,			PR_5,				2009-12-29 08:31:21,			7

Store
	StoreID   Store Locatiom   Store Name
	STR_1		Bangalore			Walmart 
	
Now the problem is , all the three files don't have a common column. 
Store Id is present in sales and store file and
ProductId is present in Product and Sales file

Now we want to join all the three files. This is the senerio in which we will use map join

Total Revenue Generator by each store location?

To solve this problem first we have to make all the three file available in the Mapper. So that the mp function
can access all the data present in these files.
As we cannot read these three files in a single mapper class, so well be using distributed cache here.
As the two files are small i.e. product and store we will put tese two files in cache  and during job execution
Hadoop will put these two file in mapper nodes local memory.
And the third file will be read from HDFS.

Here Distributed cache gives us two advantages:
First It has allowed us to read all the three files in one shot.
Fast join can be performed
