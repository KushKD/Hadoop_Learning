In Map reduce Joins can be performed in two ways:
	Reduce Side Join
	Map Side Join
	
Reduce Side Join is easy and Simple to run than Map side Join. Before the Reducer Works, 
Sorting and Shuffling pase is already been completed and this phase sends identical keys to the same reducer
and te data is organized for us.

Performig Join on organized data is much easy than performing join on unorganized data


Sudo Code Flow for Joins Map Reduce

File 1

1 JAck
2 Simon
3 Martin
4 Marry
5 Jones

File 2
1 London
2 Paris
3 Delhi
4 Mumbai 
5 Rome

First the Map Phase output is:-
Key Value
1 	JAck
2 	Simon
3 	Martin
4 	Marry
5 	Jones
5 	London
4 	Paris
3 	Delhi
2 	Mumbai 
1 	Rome

Second is the Partitioner Phase: 
Key 	Value
1		[(A Jack),(B Paris)]
2		[(A Simon),(B Rome)]
3		[(A Martin),(B Mumbai)]
4		[(A Marry),(B Delhi)]
5		[(A John),(B London)]

Partitioner has also done the sorting on the basis of key so the reducer will now get a sorted list of Key Value
Till Now no Joining is done and the Actual joining will be done on reducer Side.

Creating two list on the Basis of File Identifier i.e. A,B
List one Contains A i.e. jack, Simon, Martin, MArry John
List Two Contains B i.e. Paris,Rome,Mumbai,Delhi,London

Last step is to join these two lits

Joining the two list will be done using the nested for loop. 
For every word i list A combine it with every word in list B
